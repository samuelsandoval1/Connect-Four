## Connect Four
[Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

Rules:
* The board has 7 columns and 6 rows
* 2 players take turns "dropping" 1 pieces each turn into any column of their choosing with an available row
* Pieces "dropped" into a column must occupy the bottom-most available row.
* A column that is full cannot have more pieces dropped in.
* The first player to connect a straight line of 4, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game
